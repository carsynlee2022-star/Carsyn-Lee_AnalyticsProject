# Kaggle Machine Learning Project – Predictive Modeling Analysis

---

## Overview

This project was completed as part of a competitive Kaggle data science challenge and was assigned during my Business Analytics course during undergrad. 
The objective was to develop a predictive model using structured data and evaluate performance using standard machine learning metrics.

The project demonstrates applied skills in:

- Data cleaning  
- Feature engineering  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Predictive modeling  

---

## Business / Analytical Objective

The goal of this analysis was to:

- Explore and understand the dataset using univariate and bivariate analysis.
- Identify key predictors influencing the target variable  
- Develop and evaluate machine learning models  
- Optimize performance through feature selection and tuning  

---

## Dataset

- **Source:** Kaggle competition dataset  
- **Observations:** 1460
- **Features:** 79 
- **Target Variable:** SalePrice  

### Data Preprocessing Included:

- Handling missing values  
- Encoding categorical variables  
- Feature scaling (if applicable)  
- Outlier inspection and removal

## Methodology

The project followed a structured analytics pipeline:

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Summary statistics  
- Correlation analysis  
- Distribution visualizations  
- Identification of patterns and anomalies  

### Data Preparation

- Data cleaning and transformation  
- Feature engineering  
- Train-test split  

### Model Development

Models tested included:

- Linear Regression / Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest  
- Gradient Boosting / XGBoost  

### Model Evaluation

Performance was evaluated using:

- Accuracy / RMSE / MAE 
- Cross-validation  
- Feature importance analysis

## Key Results

- The best-performing model achieved:  
 I achieved an r2 value of 79%, which indicates that 79% of the changes in SalePrice can be explained by my models predictors, indicating good performance.

- Feature importance analysis identified key drivers such as:  
  - 'BsmtFullBath_1',
  - 'KitchenQual_Ex',
  - 'KitchenQual_Gd', 

- Model performance improved after feature engineering and tuning.
